## üí¨ How It Works

### Workflow
1. **You speak/type** a natural language request
2. **AI understands** your intent and extracts details
3. **System checks** your calendar for conflicts
4. **Action executes** (schedule/update/delete/find)
5. **You get confirmation** with clear feedback

### Voice Commands
The assistant recognizes these confirmations:
- "yes", "confirm", "go ahead", "do it"
- "create it", "update it", "delete it"
- "sounds good", "perfect", "alright"

### Examples

**Scheduling:**
```
You: "Schedule a team meeting tomorrow at 3 PM"
AI: "‚úÖ Event created successfully! Team Meeting scheduled for tomorrow at 3 PM"
```

**Updating:**
```
You: "Update the client call on Friday to start at 2 PM"
AI: "‚úÖ Event updated successfully! Client Call has been modified"
```

**Deleting:**
```
You: "Delete the project review tomorrow"
AI: "‚úÖ Event deleted successfully! The event has been removed from your calendar"
```

**Finding Slots:**
```
You: "Find available 30-minute slots tomorrow morning"
AI: "I found 3 available slots tomorrow morning: 9:00 AM, 10:30 AM, 11:00 AM"
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

**Voice Issues:**
- Speak clearly and use recognized confirmation words
- If voice doesn't work, try typing instead
- ADK is not yet in it's full potential when it comes to voice-enabled agentic conversation, so this application's maximum potential is utilized in text-conversation
